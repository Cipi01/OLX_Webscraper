#### This project encompasses some of the most well-written (in my opinion) personal web scrapers, focusing on the automobiles and electronics domain. All web scrapers use the website's public API to receive the data, making them very accurate and capable of extracting a large amount of data.
### OLX
Made up of 2 heavy web scrapers, one focusing on motorcycles and the other on vehicles. As presented with the Ejobs web-scraper, it is a bit slow since the website does not show all available offers if filters are not applied.
